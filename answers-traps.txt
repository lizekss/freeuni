1. registers a0-a7 store arguments, 13 was stored in a2

2. f and g weren't called in main. result 12 was directly passed 

3. printf is located at address 0000000000000630

4. ra should hold the return address so it will have value 38 (the next instruction)

5. Output is "He110 World"
   for big-endian we would need i = 0x726c6400
   57616 in hex is 110, would be the same 

6. it will be assumed that value of y is in a2, so contents of a2 will be printed
