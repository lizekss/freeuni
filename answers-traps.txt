1. registers a0-a7 store arguments to functions. 13 was stored in a2

2. f and g aren't called in main. the compiler precalculated and passed 12 (this is at line 26)

3. printf is located at address 0000000000000630

4. ra should hold the return address so it will have value 38 (the next instruction to execute)

5. Output is "He110 World"
   57616 in hex is 110
   for big-endian we would need i = 0x726c6400

6. it will be assumed that value of y is in a2. so whatever is in a2 will be printed
