1. usertrap() called syscall

2. value of p->trapframe->a7 is 15
it represents the system call number

3. the cpu was previously in machine mode

4. the kernel panics at line ```num = * (int*) 0```
   register a3 corresponds to num

5. kernel crashed because it tries to read from unmapped memory 0
scause value is 13 = Load page fault, which confirms this

6. ```p p->name``` printed "value optimized out"
   so i couldn't answer this
